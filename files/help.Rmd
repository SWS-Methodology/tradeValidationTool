The interactive tool for trade data validation consists in two
modules:

* [Bilateral trade flow](http://hqlprsws1.hq.un.fao.org:3838/outliers/)
* [Module/FAOSTAT comparison, flows](http://hqlprsws1.hq.un.fao.org:3838/flows/)

As the names suggest, the first one deals with bilateral trade
flows (i.e., at the "complete trade flow" level), while the second
and third ones with comparisons of module and FAOSTAT aggregated
data (i.e., at the "total trade flow" level).

By using the tools (singularly, or, possibly, in combination one
with each other) trade data can be scrutinised and eventually
corrected.

In the next sections, the modules will be explained in detail.

While indeed the bilateral and total trade tools for validation
lives in two different pages, the latter can be accessed by the
former in the "Module/FAOSTAT flows" component (technically, this
is an iframe that opens the "flows" app inside the bilateral
validation tool).

## Bilateral trade flows

The interactive tool for validating bilateral trade flows is
available at:

<http://hqlprsws1.hq.un.fao.org:3838/outliers/>

The first time the tool is accessed, the complete dataset with
bilateral trade flows will be loaded. Given that it consists of
more than 14 million of bilateral transactions, it will require
some seconds to load (around 30 seconds). Once it is accessed by
someone, the whole dataset remains in the server cache until there
is at least one analyst using it.

When you load the app, it looks like the image below.

![Initial state][initial]

In order to access the functionalities of the tool, you will have
to write your user name in the "User name" field, then select a
reporter (or more reporters) and and item (or "All items", which
is the default). When you do this, you can click on "Select DB" so
that your choice is saved.

The app is composed by seven components:

* **Plots**
* **Datatable**
* **Corrections**
* **Outliers stats**
* **Other graphs**
* **Mapping**
* **Module/FAOSTAT flows**

The next sections explain the various components

### Plots

In this component you can plot graphs of the unit value, quantity
and value for a combination of "reporter", "partner", "flow" (1 =
imports, 2 = exports) and "item", which can be selected in the
menu on the left column or, more likely, in the "Datatable" table
where the outliers are shown (you'll have to click on "link";
details further in the text).

When you click on the menu under "Choose a reporter:", a list of
reporters appears and you can select one reporter.

![Reporter selection][reporter_selection]


The same for partners (notice that you can write the name of the
country and those that match will remain visible).

![Partner selection][partner_selection]


A similar approach should be used for selection the item
(commodity).

![Item selection][item_selection]

Once you define your selection, you can click on "Draw the plot"
to see the plots (note that you can also choose a combination of
reporter/partner/flow/item in the "Datatable" component; see
below). An example of the results can be seen in the following
graph.

![Results][results_selection]

In the first three graphs, colors represent (not all variables are
shown in all graphs):

* **red**: original variables (i.e., unit value, quantity, and
  value)
* **orange** moving averages.
* **purple**: mirror flow (if/when it exists).
* **black**: "corrected" series (will show up once a correction is
  done; see next section).
* **yellow**: median with respect to all reporters.
* **green**: median of the world.

Outliers, defined by using the "fixed threshold" method (see the
definition below in the "Datatable" paragraph), are shown with a
black point.

Below the three first three graphs, there is an infobox that shows
the number of countries with which the reporter has had at least
one flow of that commodity in the whole period condidered (in the
example it says: "Number of different partners on the whole
sample:  43").  Just below this information, there is a graph
showing the distribution of actual partners by specific years.

There is also a graph showing the aggregated flow of the selected
commodity for the repoter under analysis.

Finally, a snapshot of the data is show at the end of the page.

After you draw the plots, you can download the underlying data by
clicking the "Download" button.

![Download data][download_selection]

Moreover, in this screen you can do corrections to outlying
observations.

Note: instead of selecting combinations of
reporters/partners/items in order to search for outliers, it is
possible to select the series with outliers in the "Datatable"
component, which will be described further. This allows to save some
time by focussing only on countries with outliers. You may want to
have a look at that section before reading how to actually correct
outliers, as it shows how the outliers are identified.

#### Choose a correction type

If you need to correct some anomalous (outlier) observation, you
can do it in the "Plots" component.

It is possible to correct either the value or the quantity. In
both cases, the main value that gets corrected is the unit value
and, consequently, the veriable you decided to correct by
considering the other variable as correct. Thus, if you decide to
correct a quantity you first have a look at the unit value of that
transaction, fix it and then the imputed quantity will be given by
the ratio between the value and the corrected unit value;
conversely, if you want to correct a value, you fix the unit value
and the imputed value is obtained by multiplying the quantity by
the corrected unit value.

You can choose the year for which you want to do a correction
("Choose a year to correct:") and a type of correction ("Choose a
type of correction:"):

* **None**:
  This should be used to confirm that an outlier is OK and should
  not be corrected.
* **Measurement factor**:
  This can be useful if the quantity or value may have been
  reported with a wrong measurement unit, by a factor of 10.  If
  you choose this option, it will be displayed below if the ratio
  of the unit value to the median unit value is "near" a factor of
  10 and will suggest which factor is the most likely. More
  technically, the ratio between the unit value and the median
  unit value is computed: if this ratio is greater than or less
  than (with a 10% approximation) $10^(round(log10(ratio)))$ then
  it means that the transaction was likely reported with a unit of
  measurement (of a factor of 10) issue.
* **Mirror flow**:
  Use the flow of the partner, if it exists (if it does not, you
  will get a feedback indicating that).
* **Outlier correction**:
  It is possible to use three different types of correction (in
  all cases, the values of these figures will be printed, so that
  you can choose the most appropriate):
    - **Median partners**: median with respect to all partners, that
      is, the median for the reporter's trade (import or export
      specific) in the year of interest of the analysed commodity to
      all its partner is used.
    - **Median world**: median of the unit value of all reporters to
      all partners, that is, the median of all the reporters that
      traded (import or export specific) the analysed commodity in
      the year of interest is used.
    - **Moving average**: the three year-moving average (starting
      from the year previous to the one analysed) of the unit
      value of the trade flow of the commodity of the analysed
      reporter.
* **Expert knowledge**: literature or otherwise justified figure,
  in other words, this is a figure that an analyst set given some
  external source.

In the image below, the year was set to 2012, and the menu for the
correction type shows the alternatives.

![Correction menus][correction_menus]
  
In "Optional comment/note:" you **can** write a comment that will
be saved into the corrections table. If the type of correction is
given by "Expert knowledge" then the note becomes "Mandatory
comment/note" and the comment **must** be written (basically, if
an expert gave a specific number, the name of the expert and/or
the source of the data must be written here).

You can apply the correction by clicking "Apply correction", In
this case the unit value and quantity (or value) plots will show a
new series which contains the correction.

The following figure shows a correction example: in 2012 we
suspect that the quantity variable is too high, which is reflected
in a low unit value. We set the new unit value to be equal to the
median unit value with respect to all partners (Choose a year to
correct: &gt; 2012; Choose a type of correction: &gt; Outlier
correction; How to correct unit\_value: &gt; Median partners). A
black line will show the new value (the original value is still
visible, in red).

![Corrrection example][correction_example]

You can remove the old (or original) series by clicking the
"Remove old series" button. If you want it back, click again on
the same button.

Once you are confident with the correction, click "Confirm
correction". This will open a confirmation menu, where you can
confirm (OK) or go back. In the case you confirm, the correction
will be saved in the correction table that can be visualised in
the "Corrections" component (see below).

![Confirm correction][correction_success]


### Datatable

This table presents all the observations classified as outliers.
In the current configuration of the app, the definition criterion
for which an observation is considered an outlier can be chosen by
the user (when you choose a criterion here, this will be used also
in the "Outliers stats" and "Other graphs" component, not in the
"Plots" component). We propose four criteria:

* **Fixed threshold**:
  (Default method) Observations are outliers if the ratio of the
  unit value to its 3-year moving average is below 0.5 or above
  1.5 (the three year period starts in the year immediately before
  the analysed year; the moving average for the first three years
  is computed as a "forward" moving average).
* **Variable threshold**:
  Similar to the "Fixed threshold" method (see above), but
  thresholds are defined as the 5th and 95th percentiles of the
  distribution of the ratio computed specifically for the item
  (e.g., there are different thresholds, for "maize (corn)",
  "mushrooms and thruffles", etc.). In other words, for each
  commodity the distribution of the unit value and the three-year
  moving average is obtained and the thresholds are set as the
  5th and 95th percentile.
* **100 median**:
  A unit value is considered an outlier if it is below 1/100 or
  above 100 times the median unit value of all reporter/partners
  (i.e., flow/item/year specific).
* **Boxplot**:
  A unit value is an outlier if its logarithm is outside the
  intervals defined as $Q1-1.5*(Q3-Q1)$ and $Q3+1.5*(Q3-Q1)$,
  where Q1 and Q3 are the first and third quartile of the
  logarithm of the unit values of that specific item/flow
  combination with respect to all partners of the reporter.

Each row has a "link": if you click this, the
reporter/partner/flow/item combination will be shown in the
"Plots" tab.

![Table with outliers][outliers_table]

The meaning of the columns is self explanatory, except:

* **ma**:
  The 3-year moving average of the unit value.
* **perc.value**:
  Is the percentage of the value of the transaction over the total
  value of the flow for the reporter (e.g., the value of US
  imports of maize from Mexico over the total value of the imports
  of the US).
* **perc.qty**:
  Percentage of the quantity of the transaction over the total
  quantities traded by the reporter for that item (e.g., the quantity
  of US imports of maize from Mexico over the total quantity of maize
  imported by the US).


The table can be filtered by using the table headings. For
instance, let&rsquo;s say that only the imports of the US from
Mexico requires analysis: in this case, "United States of America"
(or just some part of the whole name) should be written in the
field below "reporter\_name", "Mexico" (or a part of the name)
below "partner\_name", and "1" under "flow".

![USA - Mexico example][sort_example]

The table is sortable, by clicking on the table headings. For
instance, the flows with the highest unit values can be seen by
clicking on "unit\_value": the default behaviour is to sort in an
ascending order, thus you should click again in order to have a
descending order.

![Sort][sort_example_uv]

### Corrections

This is the "Corrections table", i.e., the table that contains all
corrections that should be applied to the trade data.

The columns are:

* **reporter**:
  Reporter country (M49 code).
* **partner**:
  Partner country (M49 code).
* **year**:
  Year.
* **item**:
  Item (CPC code).
* **flow**:
  Flow (1 = import; 2 = export).
* **data_original**:
  The data originally produced by the module.
* **data_type**:
  The type of data (qty = quantity; value = monetary value) --
  **Currently only "qty" is supported**.
* **correction_level**:
  The classification code to which the correction is applied --
  **Currently only "CPC" is supported**.
* **correction_hs**:
  If "correction\_level" is "HS" in this field should be
  indicated which HS code needs the correction.
* **correction_input**:
  The corrections to be applied.
* **correction_type**:
  See the "Choose a type of correction:" options in the "Plots"
  component.
* **correction_note**:
  Automatically inserted string; Varies automatically by
  "correction\_type".
* **note_analyst**:
  The note inserted in the "Optional comment/note:" field
  in the "Plots" component.
* **note_supervisor**:
  Supervisor note -- **Not yet implemented**.
* **name_analyst**:
  Name of the person who inserted the correction
* **name_supervisor**:
  Name of the person who approved the correction -- **Not yet
  implemented**.
* **date_correction**:
  Date when the correction was saved.
* **date_validation**:
  Date when the correction was approved -- **Not yet
  implemented**.

You can delete a correction by clicking on it in the table (it
will be highlighted) and then clicking on the "Delete selected
correction" button above the table. An example will be shown
further.

Once you save a correction you should see a message like the
following:

<pre>Last correction saved on 2017-06-07 (at 18:21:04), reporter: 642, partner: 616, item: 0112, flow: 1, year: 2012, method: Outlier correction.</pre>

in the box above the corrections table if the saving was
succesful. This is also shown in the next figure.

![Correction confirmation][correction_confirm]

If the correction could not be saved because there is
another correction for the same flow, the message will be:

<pre>Sorry, the correction cannot be saved as there is already an existing correction.</pre>

This situation is shown in the next figure.

![Correction failure message][correction_fail]

You will also have an immediate feedback in the "Plots" component if
the correction could not be saved. The message says "The
correction cannot be saved. See the &quot;Corrections&quot;
component." See next figure.

![Correction failure message in "Plots"][correction_fail_plots]


In this case you should think about which correction you really
need/want to retain. If you want to overwrite a previous
correction in order to save a new one, you have to delete the
previous one (as explained above).

![Delete correction][correction_delete]

**This table should be saved in the SWS. Currently, this is
not implemented.**

### Outliers stats

In this component some statistics on outliers will be shown (the
criterion chosen in "Datatable" will be used; by default it is
"Fixed threshold"). The aggregations that can be done are by:

* reporter
* item
* reporter and item

The table reports:

* **n.out**:
  Number of outliers.
* **n.tot**:
  Number of total observations.
* **perc.out**:
  Percentage of outliers (n.out/n.tot).
* **perc.value**:
  The percentage of the value of observations considered outliers
  over the total value.

The following graphs show the tables that can be generated.

![Outliers by reporter][outliers_reporter]

![Outliers by item][outliers_item]

![Outliers by reporter and item][outliers_reporter_item]


### Other graphs

This component is intended to have some graphs that helps the
analyst to spot the cases that need more attention (the outlier
criterion chosen in "Datatable" will be used; by default it is
"Fixed threshold"). Currently it has the following graphs (click
"Generate graphs" to see them):

* **Heatmap**:
  By reporter and year, different colors show the distribution of
  outliers. See the legend under the graph.
* **Treemap**:
  This graphs show a hierarchic distribution of outliers: the
  first rectangle shows the country ranked first by percentage of
  outliers and within this rectangle it shows rectangles with
  years ranked by percentage of outliers; the second rectangle
  shows the country ranked second by percentage of outliers, and
  within this rectangle it shows rectangles with years ranked by
  percentage of outliers; repeat for all reporters.

The next figure shows how the heatmap looks like.

![Heatmap][graphs_heatmap]

The next figure shows the initial screen of the treemap. As said
before, this is a hierarchical visualisation: in the upper
leftmost square the reporter with the highest percentage of
outliers is displayed, below you find the second, then the third
and so on.

![Treemap][graphs_treemap]

If you click on a square, it will show the distribution of
outliers by year ordered from the most problematic year (you can
go back by clicking the "< Back" button placed in the top-right of
the graph). An example is shown in the following figure.

![Treemap, country distribution][graphs_treemap_expand]

### Mapping

**NOTE**: this component is not being used as the mapping has been
integrated into the complete\_tf\_m49 module.

This component helps you to transform an XLSX file with mapped
HS&gt;FCL codes into a CSV file of mapped codes to be uploaded
into the SWS.

Your XLSX file should be structured like shown in the following
figure.

![Mapping file][mapping_file]

The following columns need to be present in the
**unmapped_hs_2000_2015** sheet:

* **Mapped by**: An optional string that indicates who did the
  mapping
* **year**: the year where the code was first found to be unmapped
* **reporter_fao**: the FAO country code of the reporter relative
  to the unmapped code
* **reporter**: the name of the reporter
* **flow**: flow of the unmapped code (1 = imports; 2 = exports)
* **hs_chap**: chapter of the **hs** code
* **hs_extend**: extension of the **hs** code to the maximum
  HS length code used by the country for that year
* **fcl**: the FCL code corresponding to **hs**

In the previous figure you will notice that some HS codes were
already mapped to FCL and that some of them are not yet mapped
(there is an **NA** in the corresponding cell).

You can process this file by clicking on "Browse..." as shown in
the next figure.

![Upload file][mapping_screen]

You will get a confirmation that the file was successfully
uploaded when the "Uploaded completed" message appears below the
button and a table of mapped codes appears, as shown in the next
figure.

![Upload successful][mapping_uploaded]

The tool will take care of doing three things:

1. it will map unmapped codes that can be mapped by using a
   generic 6-digit HS code (available in the following file:
   <https://github.com/SWS-Methodology/faoswsTrade/blob/master/data-raw/HS2012-6%20digits%20Standard.xls>
2. it will convert the original format of the file into the format
   used in the mapping table used by the trade module (e.g., it
   will generate a **startyear** and **endyear**) by combining the
   manually updated codes with the automatically updated codes
   (see previous point)
3. it will generate a file with the remaining unmapped codes

The CSV file of mapped codes ready to be uploaded into the SWS can
be downloaded by clicking the "Download mapped codes" button,
shown in the next figure.

![Download mapped codes][mapping_download_mapped]

The downloaded file will have the following columns:

* **area**
* **flow**
* **fromcode**
* **tocode**
* **fcl**
* **startyear**
* **endyear**
* **recordnumb**
* **details**
* **tl_description**

**Note**: this is not a file you are supposed to work on. If for
some reason you open this file, do not save any modification.
Store this file somewhere in your local computer, and send it to
Team A in order to have it appended to the mapping file available
on SWS.

The file with the remaining unmapped codes can be downloaded by
clicking the "Download unmapped codes" button, as shown in the
next figure.

![Download unmapped codes][mapping_download_unmapped]

This file will be your new working file, i.e., the file that you
will continue to work on in order to map the missing codes. Please
open this file, save it as an XLSX file and continue with the
mapping process in the .xlsx file. Once you are ready to have
another batch of mapped codes translated into the file that will
be appended to the mapping file on SWS, start the process again
(upload the XLSX file, let the tool map automatically some codes,
store the CSV of mapped codes somewhere on your PC and send it to
Team A, and finally continue the loop with a new working XLSX
file).



## Module/FAOSTAT comparison

The "flows" module can be accessed at
<http://hqlprsws1.hq.un.fao.org:3838/flows/>.

### Rationale

Before showing in detail the tool, an explanation about it
existence is necessary: it allows to compare, with a handy visual
presentation, the results from the new trade module with
previously published FAOSTAT data. Given that FAOSTAT data
underwent years of validation, it serves as a validation benchmark
for the new module data. Discrepancies can be spotted very easily,
allowing this way to validate new results.

A key point in the tool is that it presents "small multiples" of
the time series of module and FAOSTAT data. What a "small
multiples" means is explained at
<http://www.juiceanalytics.com/writing/better-know-visualization-small-multiples>.

### Initial screen

When you open the tool, it presents one main section composed of
various small graphs representing the time series of
commodity/country aggregates of imports and exports. The module
data is given by the green line, while the FAOSTAT data is the red
line (FAOSTAT data ends in 2013).

The initial screen can be seen in the following figure.

![Initial screen][total_initial]

It is possible to scroll the graphs by pressing the buttons at the
top of the page, as shown in the next figure.

![Scroll graphs][total_scroll]

The left side menu is very important as it allows you to: select
the number of graphs to display, select the filters to show,
filter the graphs by specific conditions, sort the graphs.

![Left side menu][total_left_menu]

#### Select the number of graphs to display

If you find that there are too many graphs in the screen, or, on
the contrary, that there are too few, you can select in how many
rows/columns you want to split the central screen to put the
graphs. It can be accessed in the left side menu, as shown in the
next figure, where the number of rows is set to four and the
number of columns to eight (like in the figure of the initial
screen).

![Left side menu, Grid][total_left_menu_grid]

#### Add/remove labels

If you know what the graphs represent, you may want to remove some
labels so that the graphs increase a bit. For instance, in the
first screen we know that all the graphs refer to "Africa" so that
if we remove this label from below each graph, we do not loose any
information. Actually, in this case you should be careful as if
you start scrolling the graph other country aggregates may show up
and you will lose this information. A more useful application of
this is when you use the "Filter" so that you know that you will
condition the graphs to some specific condition and you will not
take the risk to remove information. The "Filter" menu will be
shown below. For now, let us remove the "area" aggregate from the
initial screen. It can be donw by deselecting the desired label
from the "Labels" menu, as shown in the next figure. Notice that
under each graph the "area" label disappeared.

![Left side menu, Labels][total_left_menu_labels]

Of course, if you want to add a label, you have to select the
desired and unselected label.

#### Filter by variables

An useful feature is the possibility to condition the graphs to
some specific values of the variables. For instance, you may be
interest in comparing module and FAOSTAT quantity data relative to
imports in Europe. This can be achieved by selecting the "Filter"
menu, as shown in the next figure.

![Left side menu, Filter][total_left_menu_filter]

Once the menu is open, it shows the variables on which the
conditioning can be done:

* area
* item
* type
* flow
* ItemGroupCode (item's numeric code)
* measuredTradeElement
* GroupCode (area's numeric code)

Following the example above, we can click on "area" and click on
"Europe", then on "type" and click on "quantity", then on "flow"
and click on "import". Note that the actual order in which you do
the selection is not important. The filtering given in this
example is shown in the next figures.

![Left side menu, Filter by area][total_left_menu_filter_area]

![Left side menu, Filter by type][total_left_menu_filter_type]

![Left side menu, Filter by flow][total_left_menu_filter_flow]

The filtering by variables can be multiple. For instance, if you
want to see Europe's and Asia's import quantities, you can select
"Asia" and "Europe" in the "area" variable, as shown in the
following figure.

![Left side menu, Filter by multiple areas][total_left_menu_filter_area_multiple]

#### Sort by variables

If you want to have plots in an order that follows some variable,
you can do it by clicking the "Sort" menu and selecting the
variable on which you want to sort the graphs.

Consider the results as they appear in the previous figure: Asia
comes before Europe (increasing alphabetical order). If you want
to have Europe before Asia, you can select the "area" variable in
the "Sort" menu.
