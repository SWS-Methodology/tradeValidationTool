The interactive tool for trade data validation deals with
bilateral trade flows (i.e., at the "complete trade flow" level).
With it, trade data can be scrutinised and eventually corrected.

**Note: A former version of the tool presented a dynamic
visualisation of FAOSTAT/module total trade comparison, but
they were very slow to generate. For this reason, a different
approach is now used to check for outliers at the total trade
level.**

## Bilateral trade flows

The interactive tool for validating bilateral trade flows is
available at:

<http://hqlprsws1.hq.un.fao.org:3838/outliers/>

The first time the tool is accessed, the *complete* dataset with
bilateral trade flows will be loaded. Given that it consists of
more than 14 million of bilateral transactions, it will require
some seconds to load (around 30 seconds). Once it is accessed by
someone, the whole dataset remains in the server cache (thus it
will load faster) until there is at least one analyst using it.

When you load the app, it looks like the image below.

![Initial state][initial]

In order to access the functionalities of the tool, you will have
to write your user name in the "User name" field, then select a
reporter and item (or "All items", which is the default). The
steps are shown in the next three figures.

![Set user name][initial_username]

![Set reporter][initial_reporter]

![Set item][initial_item]

Once you selected reporter and partner, you need to click on
"Select DB" so that your choice is saved.

The app is composed by six components:

* **Plots**
* **Datatable**
* **Corrections**
* **Check**
* **Outliers stats**
* **Other graphs**

The next sub-sections explain the various components.

### Plots

In this component you can plot graphs of the unit value, quantity
and value for a combination of "reporter", "partner", "flow" (1 =
imports, 2 = exports) and "item", which can be selected in the
menu on the left column or, more likely, in the "Datatable" table
where the outliers are shown (you'll have to click on a row;
details further in the text).

When you click on the menu under "Choose a partner:", a list of
partners appears and you can select one partner.

![Partner selection][partner_selection]


A similar approach should be used for selection the item
(commodity).

![Item selection][item_selection]

Once you define your selection, you can click on "Draw the plots"
to see the plots (note that you can also choose a combination of
reporter/partner/flow/item in the "Datatable" component; see
below). An example of the results can be seen in the following
graph.

![Results][results_selection]

In the first three graphs, colors represent (not all variables are
shown in all graphs):

* **red**: original variables (i.e., unit value, quantity, and
  value)
* **orange** moving averages.
* **purple**: mirror flow (if/when it exists).
* **black**: "corrected" series (will show up once a correction is
  done; see next section).
* **yellow**: median with respect to all reporters.
* **green**: median of the world.

Outliers, defined by using the "fixed threshold" method (see the
definition below in the "Datatable" paragraph), are shown with a
black point.

The first three graphs are for the unit value, quantity and
monetary values, respectively. Below these graphs there is a graph
showing the aggregated (i.e., total) variables of the selected
commodity for the reporter under analysis.

The element contains an infobox that shows the number of countries
with which the reporter has had at least one flow of that
commodity in the whole period considered (in the example it says:
"Number of different partners on the whole sample: 86"). Just
below this information, there is a graph showing the distribution
of actual partners by years.

Finally, snapshots of the data (bilateral reporter and partner
data, and total data) are shown at the end of the page.

After you draw the plots, it is possible to download the underlying
data by clicking the "Download" button.

![Download data][download_selection]

Moreover, in this screen you can do corrections to outlying
observations. This will be explained in the next section.

Note: instead of selecting combinations of
reporters/partners/items in order to search for outliers, it is
possible to select the series with outliers in the "Datatable"
component, which will be described further. This allows to save some
time by focussing only on countries with outliers. You may want to
have a look at that section before reading how to actually correct
outliers, as it shows how the outliers are identified.

#### Choose a correction type

If you need to correct some anomalous (outlier) observation, you
can do it in the "Plots" component.

It is possible to correct either the value or the quantity. In
both cases, the target value that gets corrected is the unit value
consequently, the variable you decided to correct will be adjusted
by considering the other variable as already correct. Thus, if you
decide to correct a quantity, you first should have a look at the
unit value of that transaction, fix it and then the imputed
quantity will be given by the ratio between the value and the
corrected unit value; conversely, if you want to correct a value,
you fix the unit value and the imputed value is obtained by
multiplying the quantity by the corrected unit value.

You can choose the year for which you want to do a correction
("Choose a year to correct:") and a type of correction ("Choose a
type of correction:"):

* **None**:
  This should be used to confirm that an outlier is OK and should
  not be corrected.
* **Measurement factor**:
  This can be useful if the quantity or value may have been
  reported with a wrong measurement unit, by a factor of 10.  If
  you choose this option, it will be displayed below if the ratio
  of the unit value to the median unit value is "near" a factor of
  10 and will suggest which factor is the most likely. More
  technically, the ratio between the unit value and the median
  unit value is computed; if this ratio is greater than or less
  than (with a 10% approximation) $10^(round(log10(ratio)))$ then
  it means that the transaction was likely reported with a unit of
  measurement (of a factor of 10) issue.
* **Mirror flow**:
  Use the flow of the partner, if it exists (if it does not, you
  will get a feedback indicating that).
* **Outlier correction**:
  It is possible to use three different types of correction (in
  all cases, the values of these figures will be printed, so that
  you can choose the most appropriate):
    - **Median partners**: median with respect to all partners, that
      is, the median for the reporter's trade (import or export
      specific) in the year of interest of the analysed commodity to
      all its partner is used.
    - **Median world**: median of the unit value of all reporters to
      all partners, that is, the median of all the reporters that
      traded (import or export specific) the analysed commodity in
      the year of interest is used.
    - **Moving average**: the three year-moving average (starting
      from the year previous to the one analysed) of the unit
      value of the trade flow of the commodity of the analysed
      reporter.
* **Expert knowledge**: literature or otherwise justified figure,
  in other words, this is a figure that an analyst set given some
  external source.

In the image below, the year was set to 2012, and the menu for the
correction type shows the alternatives.

![Correction menus][correction_menus]
  
In "Optional comment/note:" you **can** write a comment that will
be saved into the corrections table. If the type of correction is
set to "Expert knowledge" then the note becomes "Mandatory
comment/note" and the comment **must** be written (basically, if
an expert gave a specific number, the name of the expert and/or
the source of the data must be written here).

You can apply the correction by clicking "Apply correction". In
this case the unit value and quantity (or value) plots will show a
new series which contains the correction.

The following figure shows a correction example: in 2012 we
suspect that the quantity variable is too high, which is reflected
in a low unit value. We set the new unit value to be equal to the
median unit value with respect to all partners (Choose a year to
correct: &gt; 2012; Choose a type of correction: &gt; Outlier
correction; How to correct unit\_value: &gt; Median partners). A
black line will show the new value (the original value is still
visible, in red).

![Correction example][correction_example]

You can remove the old (or original) series by clicking the
"Remove old series" button. If you want it back, click again on
the same button.

Once you are confident with the correction, click "Confirm
correction". This will open a confirmation menu, where you can
confirm (OK), or go back (if you decide to go back, no correction
will be stored). In the case you confirm, the correction will be
saved in the "corrections table" that can be visualised in the
"Corrections" component (see below).

![Confirm correction][correction_success]


### Datatable

This table presents all the observations classified as outliers.
In the current configuration of the app, the definition criterion
for which an observation is considered as an outlier can be chosen
by the user (when you choose a criterion here, this will be used
also in the "Outliers stats" and "Other graphs" component, not in
the "Plots" component). We propose four criteria:

* **Fixed threshold**:
  (Default method) Observations are outliers if the ratio of the
  unit value to its 3-year moving average is below 0.5 or above
  1.5 (the three year period starts in the year immediately before
  the analysed year; the moving average for the first three years
  is computed as a "forward" moving average).
* **Variable threshold**:
  Similar to the "Fixed threshold" method (see above), but
  thresholds are defined as the 5th and 95th percentiles of the
  distribution of the ratio computed specifically for the item
  (there are different thresholds, e.g., for "maize (corn)",
  "mushrooms and truffles", etc.). In other words, for each
  commodity the distribution of the unit value and the three-year
  moving average is obtained and the thresholds are set as the
  5th and 95th percentile.
* **100 median**:
  A unit value is considered an outlier if it is below 1/100 or
  above 100 times the median unit value of all reporter/partners
  (i.e., flow/item/year specific).
* **Boxplot**:
  A unit value is an outlier if its logarithm is outside the
  intervals defined as $Q1-1.5*(Q3-Q1)$ and $Q3+1.5*(Q3-Q1)$,
  where Q1 and Q3 are the first and third quartile of the
  logarithm of the unit values of that specific item/flow
  combination with respect to all partners of the reporter.

If, for some reason, you do not want this table to show only the
outliers, but *all* the dataset (i.e., both outlier and
non-outlier observations) then it is possible to select the **All
data** in the drop-down menu under "Choose an outlier detection
method:".

Each row can be clicked on and the reporter/partner/flow/item
combination will be shown in the "Plots" tab.

![Table with outliers][outliers_table]

The meaning of the columns is self explanatory, except:

* **ma**:
  The 3-year moving average of the unit value.
* **perc.value**:
  Is the percentage of the value of the transaction over the total
  value of the flow for the reporter (e.g., the value of US
  imports of maize from Mexico over the total value of the imports
  of the US).
* **perc.qty**:
  Percentage of the quantity of the transaction over the total
  quantities traded by the reporter for that item (e.g., the
  quantity of US imports of maize from Mexico over the total
  quantity of maize imported by the US).
* **corrected**: shows whether the observation has been already
  corrected.


The table can be filtered by using the table headings. For
instance, let us say that only the imports of the US from
Mexico requires analysis: in this case, "United States of America"
(or just some part of the whole name) should be written in the
field below "reporter\_name", "Mexico" (or a part of the name)
below "partner\_name", and "1" under "flow".

![USA - Mexico example][sort_example]

The table is sortable, by clicking on the table headings. For
instance, the flows with the highest unit values can be seen by
clicking on "unit\_value": the default behaviour is to sort in an
ascending order, thus you should click again in order to have a
descending order.

![Sort][sort_example_uv]

### Corrections

This is the "Corrections table", i.e., the table that contains all
corrections that should be applied to the trade data.

The columns are:

* **reporter**:
  Reporter country (M49 code).
* **partner**:
  Partner country (M49 code).
* **year**:
  Year.
* **item**:
  Item (CPC code).
* **flow**:
  Flow (1 = import; 2 = export).
* **data_original**:
  The data originally produced by the module.
* **data_type**:
  The type of data (qty = quantity; value = monetary value) --
  **Currently only "qty" is supported**.
* **correction_level**:
  The classification code to which the correction is applied --
  **Currently only "CPC" is supported**.
* **correction_hs**:
  If "correction\_level" is "HS" in this field should be
  indicated which HS code needs the correction.
* **correction_input**:
  The corrections to be applied.
* **correction_type**:
  See the "Choose a type of correction:" options in the "Plots"
  component.
* **correction_note**:
  Automatically inserted string; Varies automatically by
  "correction\_type".
* **note_analyst**:
  The note inserted in the "Optional comment/note:" field
  in the "Plots" component.
* **note_supervisor**:
  Supervisor note -- **Not yet implemented**.
* **name_analyst**:
  Name of the person who inserted the correction
* **name_supervisor**:
  Name of the person who approved the correction -- **Not yet
  implemented**.
* **date_correction**:
  Date when the correction was saved.
* **date_validation**:
  Date when the correction was approved -- **Not yet
  implemented**.

You can delete a correction by clicking on it in the table (it
will be highlighted) and then clicking on the "Delete selected
correction" button above the table. An example will be shown
further.

Once you save a correction you should see a message like the
following:

<pre>Last correction saved on 2017-06-07 (at 18:21:04), reporter: 642, partner: 616, item: 0112, flow: 1, year: 2012, method: Outlier correction.</pre>

in the box above the corrections table if the saving was
successful. This is also shown in the next figure.

![Correction confirmation][correction_confirm]

If the correction could not be saved because there is
another correction for the same flow, the message will be:

<pre>Sorry, the correction cannot be saved as there is already an existing correction.</pre>

This situation is shown in the next figure.

![Correction failure message][correction_fail]

You will also have an immediate feedback in the "Plots" component if
the correction could not be saved. The message says "The
correction cannot be saved. See the &quot;Corrections&quot;
component." See next figure.

![Correction failure message in "Plots"][correction_fail_plots]


In this case you should think about which correction you really
need/want to retain. If you want to overwrite a previous
correction in order to save a new one, you have to delete the
previous one (as explained above).

![Delete correction][correction_delete]

This table is used by the `complete_tf_cpc` module to correct
the anomalous observations detected in the validation process.

### Outliers stats

In this component some statistics on outliers will be shown (the
criterion chosen in "Datatable" will be used; by default it is
"Fixed threshold"). The aggregations that can be done are by:

* reporter
* item
* reporter and item

The table reports:

* **n.out**:
  Number of outliers.
* **n.tot**:
  Number of total observations.
* **perc.out**:
  Percentage of outliers (n.out/n.tot).
* **perc.value**:
  The percentage of the value of observations considered outliers
  over the total value.

The following graphs show the tables that can be generated.

![Outliers by reporter][outliers_reporter]

![Outliers by item][outliers_item]

![Outliers by reporter and item][outliers_reporter_item]


### Other graphs

This component is intended to have some graphs that helps the
analyst to spot the cases that need more attention (the outlier
criterion chosen in "Datatable" will be used; by default it is
"Fixed threshold"). Currently it has the following graphs (click
"Generate graphs" to see them):

* **Heatmap**:
  By reporter and year, different colors show the distribution of
  outliers. See the legend under the graph.
* **Treemap**:
  This graphs show a hierarchic distribution of outliers: the
  first rectangle shows the country ranked first by percentage of
  outliers and within this rectangle it shows rectangles with
  years ranked by percentage of outliers; the second rectangle
  shows the country ranked second by percentage of outliers, and
  within this rectangle it shows rectangles with years ranked by
  percentage of outliers; repeat for all reporters.

The next figure shows how the heatmap looks like.

![Heatmap][graphs_heatmap]

The next figure shows the initial screen of the treemap. As said
before, this is a hierarchical visualisation: in the upper
leftmost square the reporter with the highest percentage of
outliers is displayed, below you find the second, then the third
and so on.

![Treemap][graphs_treemap]

If you click on a square, it will show the distribution of
outliers by year ordered from the most problematic year (you can
go back by clicking the "< Back" button placed in the top-right of
the graph). An example is shown in the following figure.
